        Strings:

        The String type, which is provided by Rust’s standard 
        library rather than coded into the core language, is a 
        growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type. 
        When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they might 
        be referring to either the String or the string slice 
        &str types, not just one of those types. Although this 
        section is largely about String, both types are used 
        heavily in Rust’s standard library, and both String and 
        string slices are UTF-8 encoded.

        Slices:

        Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of 
        elements in a collection rather than the whole 
        collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does
        not have ownership.
